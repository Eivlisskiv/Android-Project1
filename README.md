# Android-Project1

This small Android app made using Android Studio and Kotlin locates nearby restaurants on a map for the user.
The Google Map and Google Places API were used to display a map of the user's surroundings and information about selected restaurants. 
Facebook and Gmail's login APIs were used to allow users to login via Facebook or Gmail.
A local SQLite stores the user's favorited restaurants.
